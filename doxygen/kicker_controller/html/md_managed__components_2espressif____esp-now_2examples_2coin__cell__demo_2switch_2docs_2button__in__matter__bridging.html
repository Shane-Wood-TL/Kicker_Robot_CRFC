<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md60"></a>
Overview</h1>
<p>In the <a href="https://github.com/espressif/esp-matter/tree/main/examples/esp-now_bridge_light">ESP-NOW Matter bridge</a> example, we are creating a Matter bridge that can bridge esp-now controls from a coin cell button to devices inside a Matter fabric.</p>
<p>In general, the coin cell button can be used in an initiator role to control another ESP-NOW device in responder role. When the responder is connected to AP, special considerations are needed to manage the operations and power consumption. This application note describes a coin cell button working with such responder devices.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md61"></a>
Hardware Design</h1>
<p>Refer to <a href="./SCH_Cell_button_switch_ESP32C2.pdf">this document</a> for the schematic diagram.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows a simplified hardware design of the coin cell button circuit. <img src="img/hardware-diagram.png" alt="hardware diagram" class="inline"/></p>
<p>From the diagram, it can be seen that the button is not a GPIO, instead it is the switch that controls the power supply of the coin cell button device, i.e., when the button is pressed, the device is powered on, and tasks are executed according to the software. When the button is released, power is totally cut off. In this hardware design, up to 5 buttons can be supported. By reading the voltage level on the IO port, software can identify which button is being pressed.</p>
<p>The power of the button is supplied by a power system consisting of a coin cell battery and a large capacitor. Both can only supply unstable power for a short period. There is additional circuitry ( Boost Converter) to stabilize and extend the power supply for additional period. However the power system is still considered limited. We should try to reduce the tasks for the device to perform. And the coin cell button needs to complete its task as fast as possible.</p>
<p>As the coin cell battery and the capacitor is connected, when button is released, there will still be a small current leakage. Based on the specification of the capacitor (refer to the <a href="./BOM_Cell_button_switch_ESP32C2.xlsx">BOM</a> for details), the leakage is about 1.5$\mu$A.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md62"></a>
Software Design</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md63"></a>
Configurations</h2>
<p>A few configurations are applied to try to speed up the execution and reduce the power consumption of the button device.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_FLASHMODE_QIO=y</code>: Set flash mode to QIO.</li>
<li><code>CONFIG_BOOT_ROM_LOG_ALWAYS_OFF=y</code>: Disable the boot ROM logging.</li>
<li><code>CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_SKIP_VALIDATE_ALWAYS=y</code>: Skip image validation always.</li>
<li><code>CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_LOG_LEVEL_NONE=y</code>: Let bootloader logging level to none.</li>
<li><code>CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_COMPILER_OPTIMIZATION_PERF=y</code>: Set bootloader optimization level to -O2.</li>
<li><code>CONFIG_COMPILER_OPTIMIZATION_PERF=y</code>: Set application optimization level to -O2.</li>
<li><code>CONFIG_ESP_PHY_RF_CAL_NONE=y</code>: This disables the RF calibration during bootup.</li>
<li><code>CONFIG_LOG_DEFAULT_LEVEL_NONE=y</code>: This disables all logs.</li>
<li><code>CONFIG_ESPNOW_LIGHT_SLEEP=y</code>: This asks the device to enter light sleep before starting the next transmission.</li>
<li><code>CONFIG_ESPNOW_LIGHT_SLEEP_DURATION</code>: After <code>CONFIG_ESPNOW_LIGHT_SLEEP</code> is enabled, the duration can be set with this configuration. Default is 30ms.</li>
<li><code>CONFIG_ESPNOW_CONTROL_AUTO_CHANNEL_SENDING=y</code>: Enable auto channel switching. This feature needs to be enabled to support channel switching (see below).</li>
<li><code>CONFIG_ESPNOW_CONTROL_WAIT_ACK_DURATION=20</code>: Set timeout for waiting for acknowledgement as 20ms.</li>
<li><code>CONFIG_ESPNOW_CONTROL_RETRANSMISSION_TIMES=2</code>: Set retransmission count is 2, i.e. total maximum transmission of same data is 3.</li>
<li><code>CONFIG_ESPNOW_DATA_FAST_ACK=y</code>: When acknowledgement is reported by lower layer, call the handler callback immediately. This can greatly reduce the wait time for acknowledgement (<code>CONFIG_ESPNOW_CONTROL_WAIT_ACK_DURATION</code>).</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md64"></a>
ESP-NOW Attributes</h2>
<p>The ESP-NOW component defines an enum <code><a class="el" href="espnow__ctrl_8h.html#a51d1b70699d72f1630d68f5dba968a55" title="Control attribute. The high byte is device type, the low byte is device attribute.">espnow_attribute_t</a></code> to identify the type of control in both initiator and responder. Refer to <code><a class="el" href="espnow__ctrl_8h.html">espnow_ctrl.h</a></code> for details.</p>
<p>In this application, the attribute <code>ESPNOW_ATTRIBUTE_KEY_1</code> on the initiator (button) is bound to the responder (ESP-NOW bridge) during binding. During control, button sends <code>ESPNOW_ATTRIBUTE_KEY_1</code> to bridge attribute <code>ESPNOW_ATTRIBUTE_POWER</code>.</p>
<blockquote class="doxtable">
<p><b>Note</b> Currently, both attributes are hard-coded on both devices. In addition, on the ESP-NOW bridge, the two attributes are not checked in application level. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md65"></a>
Software Flow</h2>
<p>After boot-up and initialization is complete, the button starts to execute a task as shown below. Note however that the execution can stop anytime when the button is released.</p>
<p><img src="img/button-software-flow.drawio.svg" alt="Software Flow" style="pointer-events: none;" class="inline"/></p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md66"></a>
Operations</h3>
<p>The coin cell button can only perform on-off control to a bound responder. Following the software flow as described above, the operations performed by the device are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press the button on the device: send the control command.</li>
<li>Press and hold the key on the device for more than 2s: send the binding command.</li>
<li>Press and hold the key on the device for more than 4s: send the unbinding command.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md67"></a>
Channel Switching</h2>
<p>When the responder device is connected to an AP, the channel is fixed and determined by the AP it is connected to. On the other hand, the coin cell button is powered off most of the time. It won't be able to know on which channel the responder is at the beginning or when AP has switched the operating channel.</p>
<p>In such scenario, the auto channel switching feature is required (<code>CONFIG_ESPNOW_CONTROL_AUTO_CHANNEL_SENDING</code>).</p>
<p>In ESP-NOW auto channel switching, the initiator sends its command on a specific channel (either a saved channel or a default starting channel) and requires the responder to reply an acknowledgement when it receives the command. If the initiator does not receive acknowledgement after a timeout (<code>CONFIG_ESPNOW_CONTROL_WAIT_ACK_DURATION</code>), it considers the transmission as unsuccessful. Then it tries to retransmit the command for a number of times (<code>CONFIG_ESPNOW_CONTROL_RETRANSMISSION_TIMES=2</code>). If still no acknowledgement is received, the initiator switches to other channels to send the command.</p>
<p>Wi-Fi usage should conform to country regulations. Wi-Fi devices (so as ESP-NOW devices) should not perform transmission on a channel not allowed in the country that they reside. The allowed channel list is defined by the country code. Wi-Fi country can be set by API <code>esp_wifi_set_country</code>, and read by API <code>esp_wifi_get_country</code>. Refer to <a href="https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/network/esp_wifi.html">Wi-Fi API</a> for more details. Default country code is "01" (world safe mode). With this country code, the channel list under 2.4GHz consists of 11 channels from channel 1 to 11.</p>
<p>The initiator switches to each channel in the list and performs transmission for <code>CONFIG_ESPNOW_CONTROL_RETRANSMISSION_TIMES+1</code> times. It will skip the saved channel which has already been checked. Each transmission will follow with the same timeout wait <code>CONFIG_ESPNOW_CONTROL_WAIT_ACK_DURATION</code>. If an acknowledgement is received, the initiator stops the remaining transmissions and saves the channel for the next command transmission. If no acknowledgement is received, the initiator stops without updating the channel. When sending a command next time, the initiator repeats the above flow.</p>
<p>As described in <a href="https://github.com/espressif/esp-matter/tree/main/examples/esp-now_bridge_light/docs/esp-now-bridge-with-button.md">bridge application note</a>, the ESP-NOW power saving configurations are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wake interval: 200ms</li>
<li>Wake window: 110ms</li>
</ul>
<p>The following configuration parameters need to be tuned to work with this responder's configuration.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>CONFIG_ESPNOW_LIGHT_SLEEP_DURATION</code>: 30ms</li>
<li><code>CONFIG_ESPNOW_CONTROL_WAIT_ACK_DURATION</code>: 20ms</li>
<li><code>CONFIG_ESPNOW_CONTROL_RETRANSMISSION_TIMES</code>: 2</li>
</ul>
<p>With these configurations, it is guaranteed that one of the transmissions on the specific channel can be received by the responder in the wake interval.</p>

Power Consumption</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md69"></a>
Measurement and Analysis</h2>
<p>The measurement below is based on the above configurations. The software versions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>ESP-NOW: v2.5.1, commit: 655639</li>
<li>IDF: release/v5.2.1, commit: a322e6</li>
<li>ESP-NOW Responder: <a href="https://github.com/espressif/esp-matter/tree/main/examples/esp-now_bridge_light">ESP-NOW Matter bridge</a> in esp-matter commit f5ba14</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md70"></a>
Binding</h3>
<p>As described in Software Flow, before triggering a bind operation, there will always be a control command transmission. They are separated apart by 2s.</p>
<p><img src="./img/pc_01-tx-then-bind.png" alt="Control and Bind" class="inline"/></p>
<p>The transmission seems to take slightly more power than control. However since it is just one-time operation, it is not much of a concern. In this test, the binding channel is found during control command transmission, so there is no channel switching during binding.</p>
<p><img src="./img/pc_02-bind.png" alt="Binding" class="inline"/></p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md71"></a>
Control</h3>
<h4><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md72"></a>
One Transmission</h4>
<p>The figure below shows a typical control power consumption with 1 transmission, i.e. the responder receives and acknowledges the first transmission.</p>
<p><img src="./img/pc_03-one-tx.png" alt="One Transmission" class="inline"/></p>
<p>The total time from boot up to power off is about 126ms, with average current about 21mA. For the transmission alone, it takes about 16ms and average current about 75mA.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md73"></a>
Three Transmissions</h4>
<p>The figure below shows a power consumption involving retransmissions. It can be seen that there are a total of 3 transmissions.</p>
<p><img src="./img/pc_04-three-tx.png" alt="Three Transmissions" class="inline"/></p>
<p>Average consumption is about 32mA in 227ms. The 3 transmission is about 49mA in 119ms.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md74"></a>
Unbind</h3>
<p>The unbind power consumption is similar to bind.</p>
<p><img src="./img/pc_05-unbind.png" alt="Unbind" class="inline"/></p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md75"></a>
Channel Switch</h3>
<p>The figure below shows a channel switching scenario where AP switches channel to #10, which is almost the last channel to try in the sequence. When the button is pressed once, it performs transmissions on all channels in the sequence until it receives and acknowledgement.</p>
<p><img src="./img/pc_06-switch-channel-10-success.png" alt="Channel Switch" class="inline"/></p>
<p>Average consumption is about 39mA in 1.6s.</p>
<p>If AP switches channel frequently, it will have a big impact on the button's battery life.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md76"></a>
Detailed Analysis on One Transmission</h3>
<p>The figure below zooms in one transmission without receiving acknowledgement to analyze the power consumption.</p>
<p>The power consumption matches with the configuration values <code>CONFIG_ESPNOW_LIGHT_SLEEP_DURATION</code> (30ms) and <code>CONFIG_ESPNOW_CONTROL_WAIT_ACK_DURATION</code> (20ms). During light sleep, the device consumes about 0.3mA of current.</p>
<p><img src="./img/pc_07-tx-details.png" alt="Transmission Details" class="inline"/></p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md77"></a>
Configuration Tuning</h2>
<p>In the above measurement, we have the following configurations.</p>
<p>Coin Cell Button:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>CONFIG_ESPNOW_LIGHT_SLEEP_DURATION</code>: 30ms</li>
<li><code>CONFIG_ESPNOW_CONTROL_WAIT_ACK_DURATION</code>: 20ms</li>
</ul>
<p>ESP-NOW Matter Bridge:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wake interval: 200ms</li>
<li>Wake window: 110ms</li>
</ul>
<p>With these, we only need 2 retransmissions (total 3 transmissions) to cover one sleep interval on the bridge (refer to the calculation in <a href="https://github.com/espressif/esp-matter/tree/main/examples/esp-now_bridge_light/docs/esp-now-bridge-with-button.md">bridge application note</a> for details):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>CONFIG_ESPNOW_CONTROL_RETRANSMISSION_TIMES</code>: 2</li>
</ul>
<p>By changing but maintaining the sum of the two parameters <code>CONFIG_ESPNOW_LIGHT_SLEEP_DURATION</code> and <code>CONFIG_ESPNOW_CONTROL_WAIT_ACK_DURATION</code>, we can tune and achieve optimal current consumption and reliability for an actual product.</p>
<p>For example, we can have the following configuration values:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>CONFIG_ESPNOW_LIGHT_SLEEP_DURATION</code>: 40ms</li>
<li><code>CONFIG_ESPNOW_CONTROL_WAIT_ACK_DURATION</code>: 10ms</li>
</ul>
<p>The total gap between transmission is still 50ms, so the retransmission count needs not change. Current consumption on the ESP-NOW Matter bridge device is not impacted. These configurations allow the coin cell button to have more time in sleep and less time in waiting for acknowledgement. Hence theoretically it helps to reduce the current consumption for the coin cell button. If the reliability of controlling the responder device is not impacted, this would be a better configuration.</p>
<p>With ESP-NOW Matter bridge application, it is tested and confirmed that the reliability of the responder is not impacted. The results are presented blow.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md78"></a>
Binding</h3>
<p><img src="./img/pc_02-bind-2.png" alt="Binding" class="inline"/></p>
<p>Note that <code>CONFIG_ESPNOW_CONTROL_WAIT_ACK_DURATION</code> is the maximum time to wait for acknowledgement. The actual time the coin cell button receives the acknowledgement and powers down varies depending on when the responder replies. On the other hand the <code>CONFIG_ESPNOW_LIGHT_SLEEP_DURATION</code> is fixed.</p>
<p>Comparing this graph and the previous binding graph, transmission spends about the same amount of time. The average current consumption during this period reduces from 34mA to 30mA.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md79"></a>
Control</h3>
<h4><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md80"></a>
One Transmission</h4>
<p><img src="./img/pc_03-one-tx-2.png" alt="One Transmission" class="inline"/></p>
<p>Comparing this graph and the previous one-transmission graph, we can have a similar conclusion. The transmission time is about the same. The related current consumption is about 1.7mA less. The total time is about 1.6ms less and the average current consumption is about 0.8mA less.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md81"></a>
Three Transmissions</h4>
<p><img src="./img/pc_04-three-tx-2.png" alt="Three Transmissions" class="inline"/></p>
<p>Comparing the three-transmission graph, now the new configurations have a clear advantage. The 3 transmissions take about the same amount of time (119ms) as the gap before retransmission is still 50ms, whereas the average current is reduced from 49mA to 37mA. This is because the active wait time is reduced by 10ms and light sleep time is increased by 10ms. The same amount of time is spent in sleeping instead of active waiting.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md82"></a>
Channel Switch</h3>
<p>Similar to previous test, this test is also done after AP switches channel to #10.</p>
<p><img src="./img/pc_06-switch-channel-10-success-2.png" alt="Channel Switch" class="inline"/></p>
<p>It can be seen that the total time spent is similar (there is one less retransmission on channel 10 so the difference is about 50ms), whereas the average current is reduced from 39mA to 25mA.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md83"></a>
Detailed Analysis on One Transmission</h3>
<p><img src="./img/pc_07-tx-details-2.png" alt="Transmission Details" class="inline"/></p>
<p>This detailed graph is in line with the previous analysis results. The wait time is 10ms and the light sleep time is 40ms.</p>
<p>Total charge consumed during wait is $10.8ms \times 100mA = 300\mu Ah$.</p>
<p>Total charge consumed during sleep is $40ms \times 3.7mA = 41\mu Ah$.</p>
<p>So total charge is $300\mu Ah + 41\mu Ah = 341\mu Ah$.</p>
<p>With previous configuration, total charge consumed during wait is $20.6ms \times 90.2mA = 516\mu Ah$.</p>
<p>Total charge consumed during sleep is $30.6ms \times 4.8mA = 41\mu Ah$.</p>
<p>So total charge is $516\mu Ah + 41\mu Ah = 557\mu Ah$.</p>
<p>The new configuration consumed $38.8%$ less than the previous configuration for one full-wait retransmission.</p>
<p>In conclusion, when retransmission is involved, the new configuration saves more power. If there is no retransmission, the new configuration is slightly better or about the same.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md84"></a>
Battery Life Calculation</h2>
<p>The coin cell button uses a CR2032 battery. The typical capacity of a CR2032 battery is 225mAh. A number of factors affect the amount of charge that can actually be used by the device's operation. With the current <a href="./BOM_Cell_button_switch_ESP32C2.xlsx">BOM</a>, it is measured from test that about 25% of charge is actually used by the firmware operations.</p>
<p>Here we will present a rough estimation of the battery life of the coin cell button for the two configurations analyzed in this application note:</p>
<ul>
<li>Configuration 1<ul>
<li><code>CONFIG_ESPNOW_LIGHT_SLEEP_DURATION</code>: 30ms</li>
<li><code>CONFIG_ESPNOW_CONTROL_WAIT_ACK_DURATION</code>: 20ms</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Configuration 2<ul>
<li><code>CONFIG_ESPNOW_LIGHT_SLEEP_DURATION</code>: 40ms</li>
<li><code>CONFIG_ESPNOW_CONTROL_WAIT_ACK_DURATION</code>: 10ms</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In actual usage, usually we will only bind once and will not unbind the coin cell button from the responder. And the pattern of binding is similar to control. Hence we will only consider the control transmission.</p>
<p>In control tranmission, we will calculate the power consumption for both one time transmission and three-time transmission. We will also calculate the power consumption for channel switching. The numbers will be taken from the measurements above.</p>
<p>In battery life calculation, we assume the coin cell button will be pressed 50 times a day, and there will be 1 channel switching per day.</p>
<p>Suppose a task takes $x$ ms to complete, and the average current is $y$ mA. The charge consumed in this task is:</p>
<p>$$\frac{x \times y}{1000 \times 60 \times 60} mAh$$</p>
<p>Total charge available is:</p>
<p>$$225 \times 25% = 56.25mAh$$</p>
